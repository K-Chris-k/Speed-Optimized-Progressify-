            "text": "<p>Robâ€™s Yorkshire childhood unfolded across heather-strewn moors and whispering woodlandsâ€”a boundless playground. But in the last six years, the land truly revealed its magic.</p><p>It began with a spark on a crisp autumn eveningâ€”dry kindling catching flame as naturally as breathing. That first fire became a doorway. Weekends turned into expeditions: crafting shelters from branches, reading animal tracks like stories, learning the language of the wild.</p><p>The greatest gifts were the souls he metâ€”the forester who taught him which trees sing, the forager who showed him natureâ€™s larder, the kids seeing their first campfire, just as he once had.</p><p>Now, as Rob tends another fire beneath a star-strewn sky, woodsmoke wraps around him like an old friend. The wild gave him belonging. Not just survival, but stories.</p><p>Tomorrow, the moors will call again.Â Join the adventureâ€”click below to explore his YouTube channel.</p>",
